## üõ†Ô∏è Setting up local debugging for Mac and Windows

### Install SQL Server for local debugging
PlatformPlatform requires a SQL Server instance for debugging locally. You can use Azure SQL Edge in Docker Desktop on both Mac and Windows. On Windows you can also install SQL Server or SQL Server Express locally.

#### Running Azure SQL Edge in Docker Desktop

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) if you haven't already.
2. Run the following command to pull the Azure SQL Edge image and start a container (use a password of your choice):

       docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "SA_PASSWORD=!MySecretPassword1" -p 1433:1433 --name sql_server -d mcr.microsoft.com/azure-sql-edge

3. Add the following line to your shell's configuration file:

       export SQL_DATABASE_PASSWORD='!MySecretPassword1'

- If you're using bash, edit the `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file.
- If you're using zsh, edit the `~/.zshrc` file.

4. Restart the terminal and run `echo $SQL_DATABASE_PASSWORD` to verify that the environment variable is set correctly.

#### Windows: Installing SQL Server or SQL Server Express

1. Download and install [SQL Server Developer Edition](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) or [SQL Server Express](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads). Alternatively you can also use [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2. During the installation, set the password for the `sa` user as `!MySecretPassword1`.
3. Set the enviroment varible in Windows (PowerShell) using this command:

       $Env:DB_PASSWORD="!MySecretPassword1"

### Clone the repository

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where you want to clone the repository.
2. Run the following command to clone the repository:

       git clone https://github.com/PlatformPlatform/platformplatform.git

### Run and debug

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root folder of the cloned PlatformPlatform repository.
2. Change directory to the `account-management` folder: `cd account-management`.
3. Run the following command to restore the dependencies and tools of the project: `dotnet restore`.
4. Run the following command to build and run the application: `dotnet run --project AccountManagement.WebApi`.
5. The application should now be running. You can access the API by navigating to `https://localhost:5001` or `http://localhost:5002`.
6. To run tests, navigate to the test project folder (e.g., `AccountManagement.Tests`) and run the following command: `dotnet test`.
7. To debug the application, you can use an IDE like JetBrains Rider on both Windows and Mac or Visual Studio with ReSharper on Windows. Open the solution file (`AccountManagement.sln`) in your preferred IDE and start debugging using the built-in debugging tools.

You should now be able to run and debug your application locally on both Mac and Windows.
